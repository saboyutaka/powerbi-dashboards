# PowerBI Public Dashboards

## The way to publish and share your PowerBI dashboards via public url link. A great alternative to cast dashboards to chromecast combined with [greenscreen](https://github.com/groupon/greenscreen) and [startcast CLI](https://github.com/diequeiroz/start-chromecast-CLI)

Install Python dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install NodeJs dependencies:
```

Register an PowerBI app at https://dev.powerbi.com/apps using the following params:
- Redirect URL: http(s)://YOUR_HOST/authorize-callback
- Home Page URL: http(s)://YOUR_HOST/

Store the given Client ID and Client Secret.

Configure and run the app to autorize it to access your data:

```
export CLIENT_ID=your_app_client_id
export CLIENT_SECRET=your_app_client_secret

```

Access http(s)://YOUR_HOST/authorize and complete the OAuth2 flow.

Store the hash shown in http(s)://YOUR_HOST/authorize-callback. This is your user refresh_token.
